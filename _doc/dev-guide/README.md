## _Lightning guide to understand the basics of the project_

The syslog-ng team has started this guide to widen the community of
contributors by providing a short and fair description to the project.
This document was written for users and developers. You can find sections
about installing syslog-ng, others are for introducing you to the tools and techniques we use.

We hope that you will find this useful and will be ready to create your own ideas.
Feel free to contribute and propose your chapter ideas.
